The brain MRI scan from the provided JSON data revealed a large, heterogeneous mass in the left temporal lobe. The tumor was found to be predominantly located in the temporal-to-parietal gap (gap map), with smaller portions extending into the area hOc4la (lateral occipital cortex), area hOc4lp (lateral occipital cortex), area hIP4 (inferior parietal cortex), and area PGp (posterior superior gyrus). The tumor affected 49.22% of the temporal-to-parietal gap, 14.64% of the area hOc4la, 12.62% of the area hOc4lp, 6.36% of the area hIP4, and 4.98% of the area PGp. The tumor was segmented into three distinct regions: tumor core, peritumoral edema, and GD-enhancing tumor. The tumor core was the largest region, comprising 40.12% of the entire tumor. The peritumoral edema region was the second largest, accounting for 38.74% of the tumor, while the GD-enhancing tumor region was the smallest, constituting 21.14% of the tumor.
