The confidence of the segmentation and the model used are also discussed.

**Tumor Distribution and Impact on Brain Regions**

The brain tumor is primarily located in the right hemisphere, with significant presence in the following regions:

1. **Temporal-to-Parietal (GapMap) right**: 49.22% of the tumor is located in this region, affecting 15.55% of the region's volume. This region is involved in language processing, attention, and memory.
2. **Area hOc4la (LOC) right**: 14.64% of the tumor is located in this region, affecting 89.44% of the region's volume. This region is involved in object recognition and visual processing.
3. **Area hOc4lp (LOC) right**: 12.62% of the tumor is located in this region, affecting 84.2% of the region's volume. This region is also involved in object recognition and visual processing.
4. **Area hIP4 (IPS) right**: 6.36% of the tumor is located in this region, affecting 97.44% of the region's volume. This region is involved in spatial attention and visual processing.
5. **Area PGp (IPL) right**: 4.98% of the tumor is located in this region, affecting 22.97% of the region's volume. This region is involved in language processing and semantic processing.

The tumor's presence in these regions may impact the patient's language, attention, memory, and visual processing abilities.

**Segmentation Confidence and Model Used**

The segmentation was performed using the SegResNet model, which achieved high confidence scores:

* Dice Score: 0.91 (average), indicating a high degree of overlap between the predicted and actual tumor boundaries.
* Hausdorff Distance: 4.34 (average), indicating a low distance between the predicted and actual tumor boundaries.

These scores suggest that the segmentation results are reliable and accurate.

**Semantic Segmentation**

The tumor has been semantically segmented into three components:

* **Tumor Core** (red): represents the central, solid portion of the tumor.
* **Peritumoral Edema** (yellow): represents the surrounding area of edema and inflammation.
* **GD Enhancing Tumor** (green): represents the area of the tumor that enhances with contrast agent.

These components can aid in understanding the tumor's biology and behavior.

**Conclusion**

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the brain tumor's presence in various brain regions, along with the impact on each region. The high confidence scores and accurate segmentation results support the reliability of the findings. The semantic segmentation of the tumor into its components can aid in further understanding the tumor's biology and behavior, ultimately supporting clinical decision-making.

# **Output**

**Summary of Tumor Segmentation**

The brain tumor is distributed across various regions of the brain, with the highest presence in the Temporal-to-Parietal (GapMap) region on the right side, accounting for approximately 49.22% of the tumor volume. The tumor also extends to other regions, including Area hOc4la (LOC), Area hOc4lp (LOC), Area hIP4 (IPS), and Area PGp (IPL), all on the right side.

Semantic segmentation of the tumor reveals three distinct categories: tumor core, peritumoral edema, and GD-enhancing tumor. The tumor core, represented by the color red, is the central part of the tumor. Peritumoral edema, represented by the color yellow, is the area surrounding the tumor core, which is characterized by swelling and inflammation. The GD-enhancing tumor, represented by the color green, is the part of the tumor that shows enhancement on gadolinium (GD) MRI sequences, indicating active tumor growth.

**Detailed Regional Impact**

1. **Temporal-to-Parietal (GapMap) region**: The tumor occupies approximately 15.55% of this region, which is involved in various higher-order cognitive functions, such as language processing, attention, and memory. The presence of the tumor in this region may impact these functions, potentially leading to cognitive deficits.
2. **Area hOc4la (LOC) region**: The tumor occupies approximately 89.44% of this region, which is part of the lateral occipital complex (LOC) and is involved in object recognition and visual processing. The tumor's presence in this region may affect visual perception and object recognition abilities.
3. **Area hOc4lp (LOC) region**: The tumor occupies approximately 84.2% of this region, which is also part of the lateral occipital complex (LOC) and is involved in object recognition and visual processing. Similar to the previous region, the tumor's presence in this region may affect visual perception and object recognition abilities.
4. **Area hIP4 (IPS) region**: The tumor occupies approximately 97.44% of this region, which is part of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and is involved in attention, spatial awareness, and working memory. The tumor's presence in this region may impact attentional abilities, spatial awareness, and working memory.
5. **Area PGp (IPL) region**: The tumor occupies approximately 22.97% of this region, which is part of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and is involved in language processing, attention, and spatial awareness. The tumor's presence in this region may affect language processing, attention, and spatial awareness abilities.

**Semantic Segmentation**

The semantic segmentation of the tumor into different categories provides valuable insights into the tumor's composition and potential behavior. The tumor core, represented by the color red, is the central part of the tumor, which may be the most aggressive and rapidly growing part of the tumor. The peritumoral edema, represented by the color yellow, is the area surrounding the tumor core, which is characterized by swelling and inflammation. The GD-enhancing tumor, represented by the color green, is the part of the tumor that shows enhancement on gadolinium (GD) MRI sequences, indicating active tumor growth.

**Clinical Implications**

The insights gained from the segmentation results can guide clinical decision-making in several ways:

1. **Treatment planning**: The identification of the tumor's distribution across different brain regions can inform surgical planning, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy strategies.
2. **Monitoring tumor progression**: The segmentation results can help track changes in the tumor's size, shape, and composition over time, enabling clinicians to adjust treatment strategies accordingly.
3. **Functional preservation**: The knowledge of the tumor's impact on specific brain regions can help clinicians prioritize functional preservation during surgical interventions, minimizing potential cognitive and motor deficits.
4. **Further investigation**: The segmentation results can identify areas for further investigation, such as the potential impact of the tumor on specific cognitive functions or the role of peritumoral edema in tumor progression.

The confidence of the segmentation results, as indicated by the Dice score and Hausdorff distance, suggests that the model used (SegResNet) has performed well in accurately identifying the tumor and its components. This confidence can inform clinical decision-making and provide a foundation for further investigation and treatment planning.
