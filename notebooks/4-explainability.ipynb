      "Spatial Distribution of the Tumor:\n",
      "The tumor was predominantly located in the Temporal-to-Parietal (GapMap) region on the right side, accounting for 49.22% of the tumor. \n",
      "This region is part of the temporal lobe and the parietal lobe, playing a crucial role in auditory processing, memory, and spatial awareness. \n",
      "The tumor affected 15.55% of this region, potentially leading to symptoms like hearing loss, memory impairment, or spatial disorientation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the tumor infiltrated the Area hOc4la (LOC) on the right side, accounting for 14.64% of the tumor. \n",
      "This region is part of the limbic system, responsible for emotional processing and memory consolidation. \n",
      "The tumor severely affected 89.44% of this region, which could result in emotional instability, memory loss, and altered behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the tumor affected the Area hOc4lp (LOC) on the right side, accounting for 12.62% of the tumor. \n",
      "This region is also part of the limbic system, and its involvement could lead to memory impairment and emotional instability. \n",
      "The tumor affected 84.2% of this region.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tumor was also detected in the Area PGp (IPL) on the right side, accounting for 4.98% of the tumor. \n",
      "This region is part of the inferior parietal lobule, which is involved in various cognitive functions, including attention, spatial processing, and language comprehension. \n",
      "The tumor affected 22.97% of this region, potentially leading to difficulties in attention, spatial processing, and language comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Area hIP4 (IPS) on the right side was also affected by the tumor, accounting for 6.36% of the tumor. \n",
      "This region is part of the inferior parietal lobule, and its involvement could lead to motor deficits, sensory impairments, and spatial neglect. \n",
      "The tumor severely affected 97.44% of this region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segmentation Results:\n",
      "The segmentation results were generated using the SegResNet model, which achieved high segmentation confidence. \n",
      "The tumor core was segmented with a Dice score of 0.99 and a Hausdorff distance of 1.0, indicating accurate segmentation. \n",
      "The peritumoral edema was segmented with a Dice score of 0.98 and a Hausdorff distance of 1.0, and the enhancing tumor was segmented with a Dice score of 0.96 and a Hausdorff distance of 1.0. \n",

      "The tumor significantly affected the functional roles of these regions, potentially leading to various symptoms such as memory impairment, emotional instability, motor deficits, and sensory impairments. \n",
