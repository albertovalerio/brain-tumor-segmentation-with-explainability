Visual-and-Textual-Explainability-in-Brain-Multiple-Sclerosis-Detection-with-3D-MRI
==============================

This repository introduces a system designed to accurately segment MS lesions on 3D brain MRI scans using deep learning techniques. Additionally, the system integrates an explainability module to improve the interpretability and reliability of segmentation outcomes by using multimodal large language models and 3D Brain Atlas.
