Using the provided JSON data from a brain MRI study of the lesion segmentation computed by the AI model, please generate a comprehensive report detailing the segmentation results of MS lesions. 
Describe the lesions' presence in various regions according to the Julich-Brain Atlas noting the percentage of the lesion area within each region and the impact on the region in order to enhance the explainability of the AI lesion segmentation model to support clinical decision-making.

The report should be structured as follows:
1. **Summary of Lesion Segmentation**: Provide an overview of the lesions' distribution across various regions of the brain according to the Julich-Brain Atlas. Discuss the semantic segmentation of the lesions and their implications.
2. **Detailed Regional Impact**: For each region where the lesion is present, describe the percentage of the lesion within the region and the percentage of the region affected by the lesion. Discuss the known roles and functions of these regions in the brain and how the presence of the lesion might impact these functions.
3. **Semantic Segmentation**: Discuss the different aspects of the lesions identified by the semantic segmentation and their potential clinical implications.
