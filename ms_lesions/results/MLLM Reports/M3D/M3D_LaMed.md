[SEG] . The multiple sclerotic lesions are present in both hemispheres, with a larger region present in the left anterior high frontal region, corresponding to area A1 on the provided Flair image, encompassing approximately 17% of the area of the non-enhanced brain and demonstrating increased attenuation compared to surrounding brain tissue. A few smaller areas of increased attenuation are observed elsewhere within both hemispheres, including within region C4/C5 of the right posterior cervical spine, which area encompasses approximately 6% of the region of the right posterior cervical spine and demonstrates increased attenuation compared to surrounding tissue.
