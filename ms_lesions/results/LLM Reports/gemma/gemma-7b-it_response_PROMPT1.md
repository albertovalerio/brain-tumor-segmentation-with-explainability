## Brain MRI Lesion Segmentation Report

**Data Summary:**

This report summarizes the results of an AI-powered lesion segmentation analysis of a brain MRI study. It details the presence of multiple lesions across various brain regions, with quantification of the lesion area within each region.

**Overall Model Performance:**

- Average F1 score: 35.11 (+/- 14.26)
- Mean sensitivity: 71.76% (+/- 8.69%)
- Mean specificity: 87.45% (+/- 8.16%)

**Lesion Distribution:**

**1. Frontal-to-Occipital (GapMap) Lobe:**

- Lesion presence detected in both the left and right hemispheres.
- Left hemisphere: 26.88% of the lesions affect this region, covering 6.04% of the total regional volume.
- Right hemisphere: 16.82% of the lesions affect this region, covering 4.08% of the total regional volume.

**2. Occipital Region:**

- Lesion presence identified primarily in the left hemisphere (8.88% of lesions, 7.31% of the region).

**3. Area hOc6 (POS) Left:**

- 4.23% of the lesions identified in this region, covering 51.55% of the total regional volume.

**4. Frontal-to-Temporal-II (GapMap):**

- 3.1% of the lesions impact this region, covering 2.86% of the total volume.

**Impact on Brain Function:**

The presence of lesions in these regions suggests potential impact on the following functions:

- **Frontal-to-Occipital lobe:** Visual processing, memory, attention, language comprehension.
- **Occipital region:** Visual perception, processing of visual information.
- **hOc6 (POS):** Visual information processing, object recognition, color perception.

**Conclusion:**

The AI-powered lesion segmentation analysis identified numerous lesions across various brain regions, suggesting potential neurological impairment. Further clinical evaluation and follow-up scans are necessary to assess the progression or stability of the lesions and determine their clinical significance.
