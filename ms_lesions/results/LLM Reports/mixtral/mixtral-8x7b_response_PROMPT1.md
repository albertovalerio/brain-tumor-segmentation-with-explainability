Report on Brain MRI Lesion Segmentation Study

Introduction:
In this study, we present the results of a lesion segmentation on a brain MRI scan using an AI model. The segmentation has been analyzed according to the Julich-Brain Atlas, enabling us to describe the presence and extent of lesions found in various regions. This report aims to enhance the explainability of the AI lesion segmentation model, thus supporting clinical decision-making.

Key Findings:

1. Frontal-to-Occipital (GapMap)
- Left side: 26.88% of the lesion area is found within this region, accounting for 6.04% of the entire region.
- Right side: 16.82% of the lesion area is found within this region, accounting for 4.08% of the entire region.

2. Area hOc1 (V1, 17, CalcS) left
- 8.88% of the lesion area is found within this region, accounting for 7.31% of the entire region.

3. Area hOc6 (POS) left
- 4.23% of the lesion area is found within this region, accounting for 51.55% of the entire region.

4. Frontal-to-Temporal-II (GapMap) left
- 3.1% of the lesion area is found within this region, accounting for 2.86% of the entire region.

Impact Analysis:

- Lesions are mainly present in the Frontal-to-Occipital (GapMap) regions and Area hOc6 (POS) left. These regions are involved in sensory and motor functions, thus damaged lesions might affect those processes.
- The Frontal-to-Occipital (GapMap) regions have a lower percentage of lesions compared to the Frontal-to-Temporal-II (GapMap) and Area hOc1 (V1, 17, CalcS) left regions, but they account for a larger percentage of those regions' volumes. This suggests more scattered and less densely concentrated lesions in the Frontal-to-Occipital regions.
- The low Lesion F1 score (35.11) and the nDSC value (71.76) indicate that there's room for improvement in the AI model's segmentation performance. This highlights potential issues like an imbalance in the training data, limitations in the model architecture, or a need for further data augmentation.

Conclusion:

In this report, we described the AI model's segmentation results in various brain regions, as defined by the Julich-Brain Atlas. We identified the affected regions and the percentage of the lesion area within these regions, and subsequently analyzed the impact on the regions. The report serves to enhance the explainability of the AI lesion segmentation model, therefore aiding clinical decision-making, yet the overall model performance still has room for improvement.
